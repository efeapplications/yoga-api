Your fingers should be curled up naturally. Close your eyes and focus on your breathing. Breathe from your diaphragm, which is in your lower belly. Push out the muscles in your diaphragm as you inhale. Inhale for five counts. Then exhale for another five counts. Repeat the breathing sequence until you feel relaxed.",
